A very basic standalone calculator for Captain of Industry (vanilla v0.6.4d) to help you manage your monthly diesel fuel usage and production. The cargo ships' fuel consumption is also calculated on a monthly basis.

I was getting annoyed by losing track of my diesel usage and production, 
so I looked for a small programming project since I recently started learning C#.
I'm looking forward to starting to mod this game at some point too.
If you find any bugs or have ideas on how to improve or further develop this program, please let me know.
